# ResearchMatch AI

ResearchMatch builds evidence-based Zayed University researcher profiles and matches
a research topic to suitable collaborators. The first pilot covers 50 candidates
across Business and Technological Innovation.

Research data will live in Bronze/Silver/Gold Delta tables, with one AI Search
endpoint. Lakebase is reserved for optional application state.

## Collect the source data

1. Install Python dependencies from `requirements-collection.txt`.
2. Put your OpenAlex key in a local `.env` file as `OPENALEX_API_KEY=...`.
3. Run the collector from the project root:

```sh
python3 scripts/collect_sources.py --source all --batch data/landing/pilot-20260905
```

Downloads preserve original JSON, XML, and HTML. Reuse the same batch path to resume
an interrupted run; choose a new path for a refresh. Data and secrets are ignored by
Git. The collection scripts run locally and do not upload or modify Databricks.

## Load the uploaded collection

The two batches are uploaded under `/Volumes/workspace/researchmatch_bronze/landing/`.
Follow the [Volume-to-Bronze runbook](docs/volume_to_bronze_runbook.md): validate two
OAI files, run the Bronze DDL if needed, load and repeat the sample, then load the
complete collection. The loader defaults to validation only and needs no API key.

## Project files

- [Product plan](docs/product_plan.md): scope, architecture, and delivery milestones.
- [Collection runbook](docs/data_collection_runbook.md): download, resume, verify, and package data.
- [First collection report](docs/collection_report_2026-09-05.md): actual counts, coverage gaps, and local artifact locations.
- [Institutional data contract](docs/institutional_data_contract.md): optional roster/award exports.
- [Bronze DDL](sql/01_create_bronze_tables.sql): creates the 11 planned Bronze tables.
- [Volume-to-Bronze notebook](notebooks/03_load_volume_to_bronze.py): validates manifested files and merges raw versions into Delta.
- [Volume-to-Bronze runbook](docs/volume_to_bronze_runbook.md): exact settings, expected counts, validation, and recovery.
- [Direct OAI notebook](notebooks/02_ingest_zu_scholars_oai.py): alternative direct API-to-Delta route.
- [Silver DDL](sql/04_create_silver_tables.sql): build snapshots, current views, and human identity decisions.
- [Silver builder](notebooks/05_build_silver.py): default validate-only transformation of existing Bronze data.
- [Silver review SQL](sql/06_review_silver.sql): read-only exploration and identity evidence.
- [Silver runbook](docs/silver_runbook.md): run order, expected counts, review decisions, and limits.

Bronze has been successfully loaded in Databricks and explored by the user. Next:
run SQL 04, validate/build with notebook 05, then review identity candidates using
SQL 06. Silver researcher–work links require explicit identity approval.

## Run offline tests

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
